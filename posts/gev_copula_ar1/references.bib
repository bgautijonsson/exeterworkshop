  abstract = {The author recalls his initial involvement with the basic notions of probability theory, which began in the late forties in the context of number theory, continued through his work with B. Schweizer on probabilistic metric spaces, and culminated in a correspondence with Fréchet that led to the identification and naming of copulas. The author speculates about possible future applications of the theory of distribution functions with given margins: In particular, there is the prospect of productive treatment of situations where, say, no common probability space can be found for a given set of "random variables," but such common probability spaces exist for arbitrary proper subsets of the given set.},
